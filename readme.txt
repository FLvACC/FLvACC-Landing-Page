The Font used in the logo is CENTURY GOTHIC idk if that is a default font
Rest of the text is a mixture of LEMON MILK Pro and LEMON MILK Pro Medium. 
When bolding a text, use the Medium font instead of bolding the pro font it looks better.

The Square PFP is for the website tab icon.

Good luck :D
